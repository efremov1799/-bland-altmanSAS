- A Bland–Altman plot (difference plot) is a qualitative method of analysis of agreement. In analytical chemistry or biomedicine it is used when analyzing the agreement between two different assays targeting the same analyte. Bland and Altman make the point that any two methods that are designed to measure the same parameter (or property) should have good correlation when a set of samples are chosen such that the property to be determined varies considerably. A high correlation does not necessarily imply that there is good agreement between the two methods, and, therefore, it should be replaced by a manual analysis of the paired data representation of some sort.

- The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a descriptive statistic that can be used when quantitative measurements are made on units that are organized into groups. It describes how strongly units in the same group resemble each other. The intraclass correlation is commonly used to asses the consistency or reproducibility of quantitative measurements made by different observers measuring the same quantity. The ICC is often used in analytical chemistry or biomedicine to quantify the agreement between various assays that target the same analyte or the agreement between measurements done by two operators on the same assay.

- Here, the Bland–Altman plot is integrated with ICC calculation that enables the overwhelming assessment of the agreement, both in qualitative and quantitative manner
